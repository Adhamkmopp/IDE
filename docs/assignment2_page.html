            <h1>How has the weather changed over the past 100 years?</h1>

            <h3>First Visualization</h3>

            <div id="container" class="svg-container">
                <svg id="temperature_ana" width="1000" height="600"> </svg>
            </div>
            <br>
            <ul class="content_container">
                <li>Motivation: The visualisation shows the changes in temperature over the trimesters December-January-February,
                    March-April-May, June-July-August and September-October-November and the annual mean over the years from 1889 to 2017
                in the city of Antananarivo in Madagascar.</li>
                <li>Method (data set description and preparation): The data set comes from the  <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data/">NASA GISS</a>
                    and it was parsed using <a href="script.R">this</a> script. The years in which the values of the temperatures where not present have been removed.
                    The dataset contains entries in three columns, Year, Month (mean of the trimesters) and temperature registered.
                </li>
                <li>Results/discussion: The plot shows a tendency of the first years analysed (in the blue gradient)
                    where temperatures were lower across the trimesters. It is interesting to see that, being Madagascar in the southern emisphere,
                    the coldest temperatures are registered in the June-July-August trimester with values reaching 0Â°C in the very early years.</li>
                <li>Conclusions: This visualisation is not interactive at <a href="http://charts.animateddata.co.uk/uktemp/">this</a> one
                    taken as a reference and the original data contained all the temperatures for all the months but they didn't look esthetically acceptable in the same plot.
                    So instead the means of the trimesters are represented. On top of that another idea of visualisation was to have lines of the
                    years to appear one after the other in the chronological order.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Second Visualization</h3>

            <div id ='berl_legend_container'>
                <svg id="temperature_ber" width="1000" height="500"> </svg>

            </div>
            <br>
            <ul class="content_container">
                <li>Motivation: This visualization of monthly temperature data of the past 100 years aims to investigate how
                    temperatures have changed over the past century in Berlin
                </li>
                <li>Method (data set description and preparation): The data was collected from a metereological station in Berlin (Berlin-Tempel (52.5 N,13.4 E))
                    by NASA. A few values were missing and were coded as 999.9 or 999.90. These were manually estimated as the average of
                    neighboring months. If neighboring months were also absent, then estimates were obtained from the averages
                    of neighboring months of a previous year. This was sufficient to account for every missing value.
                </li>
                <li>Results/discussion: As seen in the plot, there appears to be a general increase in temperatures. This is especially noticable
                    in January, the coldest month of year. The actual increase however might not be large enough to be considered
                    significant.  
                </li>
                <li>Conclusions: As stated in the discussion there seems to be a general increase in overall temperature, and in turn,
                    that finding could lend support to the theory of global warming. What the
                    visualization alone fails to deliver is a meaningful statistic to test for the significance of such an increase
                    .The data itself may need to be adjusted to match the technological advancements in the accuracy
                    of the equipment used to take the readings, and to exlclude unreliable past readings. It it also important to remember
                    that this was a visualization on temperatures taken in Berlin only, and therefore locally restricted. A broader representation of disparate
                    locations should be considered before arriving to serious conclusions planet-wise
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Adham</h2>
            <p class="content_container">
                Which data set (that is realistically possible for you to obtain) and visualization would you include to give a more confident answer to the articles main question? A mockup is welcome.
                As mentioned in the discussion, the data is local to Berlin only. A visualization of temperatures taken from a different station on the Southern Hemisphere
                showing similar patterns could be useful for comparison. Better yet, a visualization by zone imposed on a global map
                showing mean increases/decreases (sesonal on annual) over a period of time relative to another (as shown in detail here: <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/maps/">NASA's Global Map</a>
                ). Other factors may have contributed to fluctuations in temperatures such as changes in global wind patterns, the surrounding population density and industrialization. The latter two
                epsecially may be significant in supporting the findings as they are often cited as the culrprit for global warming and erratic weather behavior.
                It has also occured to me that a stacked bar chart (non-normalized with Years on the horizontal axis and Temperatures on the vertical axis) of monthly temperatures
                may have given a less cluttered and straight forward view on total temperature increases or decreases per year. Lastly, NASA also
                hosts oceanic temperatures which, one would assume, would mirror the temperature patterns witnessed on land lending further support to it.

            <h2>Carlotta</h2>
            <p class="content_container">
                So far we've only taught static visualizations. Which dynamic elements or interactions could improve your article? To improve the visualisation an interaction
                as the one presented <a href="http://charts.animateddata.co.uk/uktemp/">here</a> would improve the user experience.
                The lines on the years would appear when the user click on a point and a pop up window could appear with the name of the selected year.
                This would make the visualisation less confusing and more clean. This could also be applied to all months instead of just the
                four trimesters providing more information. The choice of keeping only those means was made also for the reason of having
                too many lines overlapping.
