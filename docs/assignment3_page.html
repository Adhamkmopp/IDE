            <li>
                Motivate your choices (e.g. choice of color/marks, overall layout etc)
                <br>
                The layout has been adapted from the d3 tree <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/5537fe63086c4f100114f87f124850dd">layout</a>.
                The branches have been modified so that Donald's partners and his children's partners are on the same level.
                Symbols indicating the sex have been added to each node; the symbols come from the library of <a href="https://thenounproject.com/sanjivinibetta/">this author</a>.
                The circles around the nodes follow the colors explained in the legend.
                When overing on a node with the mouse, a pop up rectangle shows information about date of birth of the selected individual.
                When clicking on a node, if present, the wikipedia page about that individual is opened in a new window in the browser.
                The dataset provided has been modified adding, for each individual of the family: date of birth, url to the wikipedia page,
                a sex tag, a 'is_family' tag to specify the relation to Donald.

            </li>
            <li>Suggest how/if the visualization could be improved by adding interactive elements.
                <br>
                As it stands, clicking on an icon takes you out to that descendant's wikipedia page.
                An improvement on this could be including a window, or a bar to the right of the tree with a small portrait and a short summary
                (possibly parsed from wikipedia under "personal life" section) of the individual, their education, accomplishments (or scandals) etc. on
                mouse click on their names or nodes and for it to also include a icon/link out to the full wikipedia page.
                Another improvement would be including the non-Trump partners' family trees (on a seperate layer that only becomes visible
                and pushed to the forefront on click). Finally, it may not be quite worth it given the size of the tree and age of the family,
                but highlighting the branch line (color change or thickness along the branch) on mouse click or hover could
                be a neat idea to show the direct line of ancestry for each one of Trump's descendants.
