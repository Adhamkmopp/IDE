    <p>
        As the name suggests, the aim of the survey was to track the quality of life of Europeans
        through a questionnaire of 195 points that addresses a large range of issues “...
        such as employment, income, education, housing, family, health and work-life balance. It also look[ed]
        at subjective topics, such as people's levels of happiness, how satisfied they are with their lives,
        and how they perceive the quality of their societies...”.
        For our purposes, out the 195 variables, we have selected the 'World Health Organization (WHO) Mental Well-being Index', and
        'Social Exclusion' as the two main variables to visualize and explain. Our choice was motivated by personal
        interest in those two variables firstly as major indicators of QoL on a personal and societal level respectively,
        their multifaceted nature, and more pragmatically, due to their nature of being a "Derived Variable" of
        several other variables.

    </p>
    <p>
        However, a number of responses in the questionnaire may be grouped together as ‘derived variables’
        and this report specifically seeks to examine the relationships and degress of stratification by age and
        gender of two such major variables; general wellbeing (as given by the World Health Organization (WHO)
        mental well-being index), and social integration (given by degrees of ‘social exclusion’).

    <h2>Social Exclusion & Integration</h2>
    <p>
        <br>
        Social Exclusion is a derived indicator of the quality of life of an individual from a societal perspective.
        It is described as having four dimesions; social vulnerability (how risk prone or averse an individual is
        in everyday life), perceived level of social mobility,
        sense of agency and lastly, pure economic prospects. It ranges from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating total social integration,
        and 5 extreme social exclusion
        <br>
        This can be surmised in and of itself by examining the four aggreagted variables used to derive social exclusion
        which include:
    <ol>
        <li>‘I feel left out of society.’
        <li>‘Life has become so complicated today that I almost can’t find my way.’
        <li>‘I don’t feel that the value of what I do is recognized by others.’
        <li>‘Some people look down on me because of my job situation or income.’
    </ol>

</div>

<div class="soc_excl_barplots">
    <div id="text_excl_contact_corr">
        <p>
            The plot on the right (for 2011 only as no data was collected for 2007)
            shows the average social exclusion on the histrogram bars, and the average of
            social contact (degree of direct, face-to-face contact between close family and friends, scaled to overlap
            with the histogram) on the points.

            <br>

            The plot shows that while Nordic countries rank among the highest in social integration, social contact
            is comparatively lower, or as low other countries with lower social integration, indicating that
            social contact is perhaps not a strong enough of an influence over social integration.

            The plot shows the average of social exclusion on the histogram bars, and the average of deprivation (Defined as
            the number of household items that one cannot afford) on the points.
            <br>

            Unlike the previous plot, data for both 2007 and 2011 is available, and clicking on the right and left
            arrows cycles through them. In both years, it is clear that the economic aspect of social exclusion
            carries a strong influence, as countries with higher social integration have lower rates of deprivation and
            vica versa.

    <h2>WHO Mental Well-being</h2>
    <p>
        The WHO Mental Well-being index gives a general measure of the pyschological wellbeing of an individual.
        On the one hand, it is used as an indicator of depression with a value below 50 pointing to a possible case
        of mild depression, and on the other hand, it can used to asses the level of psychological wellbeing of a
        population. Like social exclusion, it is a derived variable based on the following five questions and the
        level to which the respondants agree:
    <ol>
        <li>‘I have felt cheerful and in good spirits’
        <li>‘I have felt calm and relaxed’
        <li>‘I have felt active and vigorous’
        <li>'I woke up feeling fresh and rested’
        <li>‘My daily life has been filled with things that interest me’.
    </ol>

        <p>
            On the plot to the left, WHO Mental Well-being was split by gender to explore differences between
            males and females in 2007 and 2011. While gaps may have widened and shortened over the years, with
            some countries rising and falling slightly in the ranks, it is clear in both cases that females
            have generally higher levels of mental well being across most European countries.

    <div id="text_points_age">
        <p>
            The plot on the right similar to the one above splits WHO Mental Well-Being by age to explore
            differences between age groups. Although no obvious conslusions can be drawn on changes across the years,
            it is atleast clear that large differences in mental wellbeing exist across age groups. For example,
            the four countries with the highest overall wellbeing also share the largest gaps in wellbeing between
            its older segments and its younger segments of the population, with the oldest age groups scoring much higher
            than their younger counterparts.

            <br>
            <br>
            NOTE: We are aware that some values are calculated as being over 100, but we are convinced it is
            an issue with the weighting scale provided with the data, not with the calculation itself.
