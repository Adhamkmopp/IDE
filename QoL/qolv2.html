    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This report analyses data obtained from the European Quality of Life Survey (EQoLS),
        a pan-European survey on the quality of life of European citizens.
        The survey is conducted every 4 years by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and
        Working Conditions (Eurofound).
    </p>
    <p>
        The aim of the survey is to track the quality of life of Europeans through a questionnaire of 195 points.
        It addresses a large range of issues such as "employment, income, education, housing, family, health and work-life balance.
        It also investigate subjective topics, such as people's levels of happiness, how satisfied they are with their lives,
        and how they perceive the quality of their societies".
    </p>

    <p>
        For the purposes of the following visualisations we selected 2 variables out the 195 total variables describing the survey
        and two waves (2007 and 2011) for which the extended data set was available.
        The selection has fallen on 'World Health Organization (WHO) Mental Well-being Index' and
        'Social Exclusion'.
        Our choice was motivated by personal interest in those two variables.
        Firstly as major indicators of QoL on a personal and societal level respectively, secondly
        because of their multifaceted nature, and more pragmatically, due to their nature of being a
        "Derived Variable" of several other variables.
    </p>

    <p>
        A number of responses in the questionnaire may be grouped together as ‘derived variables’.
        This report specifically seeks to examine the relationships and degress of stratification by age and
        gender of the two chosen variables.

            The map below shows the relative levels of the WHO Mental-Wellbeing index and Social Exclusion split by
            the years the survey was taken in.
            <br>
            The pie charts on the left give a summary, in percentages, of the composition of the sample sets for
            each of the selected country in terms of education levels, gender and age groups.
            <br>
            In each country, random samples of 1000 to 3000 people were selected and provided with the survey.

            Selecting a country in the maps updates the statistics of that country in the box on the left

    <h2>Social Exclusion & Integration</h2>
    <p>
        Social Exclusion is a derived indicator of the quality of life of an individual from a societal perspective.
        It is described as having four dimensions: social vulnerability (how risk prone or averse an individual is
        in everyday life), perceived level of social mobility,
        sense of agency and lastly, economic prospects.
        It ranges from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating total social integration,
        and 5 extreme social exclusion
        <br>
        This can be surmised by examining the four aggregated variables used to derive social exclusion
        which include:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>‘I feel left out of society.’
        <li>‘Life has become so complicated today that I almost can’t find my way.’
        <li>‘I don’t feel that the value of what I do is recognized by others.’
        <li>‘Some people look down on me because of my job situation or income.’
    </ol>

    <h2>WHO Mental Well-being</h2>
    <p>
        The WHO mental well-being index gives a general measure of the psychological well-being of an individual.
        It is used as an indicator of depression with a value below 50 pointing to a possible case
        of mild depression. However, it can also be used to asses the level of psychological well-being within a
        population.
        <br>
        It is a derived variable based on the following five questions and the level to which the respondents agree:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>‘I have felt cheerful and in good spirits’
        <li>‘I have felt calm and relaxed’
        <li>‘I have felt active and vigorous’
        <li>'I woke up feeling fresh and rested’
        <li>‘My daily life has been filled with things that interest me’.

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>
        The plot visualizing the correlation between social contact and social exclusion shows that while Nordic countries
        rank among the highest in social integration, social contact is comparatively lower than other countries with lower
        social exclusion. This indicates that social contact is perhaps not a strong enough of an influence over social integration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike the previous plot, data for both 2007 and 2011 is available, and clicking on the right and left
        arrows cycles through them. In both years, it is clear that the economic aspect of social exclusion
        carries a strong influence, as countries with higher social integration have lower rates of deprivation and
        vica versa.
    </p>

    <p>
        The WHO mental well-being plot, split by gender, shows that gaps might have widened and shortened over the years, with
        some countries rising and falling slightly in the ranks. Nonetheless, it is clear in both cases that females
        have generally higher levels of mental well being across most European countries.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although no obvious conclusions can be drawn on changes across the years,
        it is at least clear that large differences in mental well-being exist across age groups.
        For example, the four countries with the highest overall well-being also share the largest gaps in well-being between
        their older group and their younger group of the population.
        For most of the countries the "64+" age group scores much higher than their younger counterparts.

<div id="div_remarks">
    <h2>Remarks</h2>
    <p>
        The data was take from the <a href="https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/">UK Data Service database</a>
        and it has been preprocessed using this <a href="QoL.R">script</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Compared to the official report about this survey by the Eurofund, which can be found
        <a href="https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/sites/default/files/ef_publication/field_ef_document/ef0988en.pdf">here</a>,
        the above visualisation of the WHO mental well-being index split by gender shows the opposite pattern.
        In fact the organization reports higher levels of mental well-being among males over females.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some values in the plot of the WHO mental well-being index, split by age groups,
        are calculated as being over 100. This issue is due to a miscalculation of the weighting scale provided with the data.
